Hi, you are playing an amazing game of GoldenCoin with Alfredina II.
Alfredina is a “AI” that was created by using a ingenious algorithms to calculate how to make a computer win. So every time you make a move, Alfredina “thinks” calculates and changes her approach towards the game. The algorithm is a secret!

Every time the new game is instantiated, main JPanel changes its color to the brightest and the most tender colors of the world. 

Also, this program is truly precious because I use an image of a golden coin instead of a silver one. 

	1.	Everything is implemented, + extra: thinking “AI” named Alfredina, image of a coin, disabled mouse click when its a computer turn, changing color of a panel, pointing out every mistake you make with the JOptionPane (so its easier for a user to know why the error occurred”), the game is never generated with the coins already at the leftmost slots, 
	2.	Worked in a group with Donna Pan, 2016
	3.	Elodie’s code for generating a random color; some stackoverflow.com ideas
